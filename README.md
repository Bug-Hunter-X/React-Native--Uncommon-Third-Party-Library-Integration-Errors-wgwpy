# React Native: Uncommon Third-Party Library Integration Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when integrating third-party libraries into React Native projects: unexpected behavior or crashes due to improper configuration.

## Problem
Many third-party libraries in React Native require specific configurations, dependencies, or might have version conflicts with other libraries or the React Native version itself.  Failing to address these can lead to subtle errors or crashes that are difficult to debug. 

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the library's documentation, ensuring all necessary dependencies are installed, and resolving any version conflicts. It often requires meticulous checking of package.json, Podfile (for iOS), and build.gradle (for Android) to verify compatibility and correct setups.   This may involve upgrading, downgrading, or carefully selecting compatible versions of libraries.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Observe the errors in the `ThirdPartyBug.js` file.
5. Refer to the corrected implementation in `ThirdPartyBugSolution.js` to understand how to fix the issue.
