The solution involves meticulously checking the third-party library's documentation and addressing any of the following:

1. **Verify Dependencies:** Make sure all required dependencies are correctly installed and compatible with your React Native version. Check `package.json` for missing or mismatched versions.
2. **Check Package Versions:** Use a version management tool (like `npm-check-updates`) to verify all libraries are updated and compatible. Resolve any version conflicts using semantic versioning principles (e.g., using `^` or `~`).
3. **Platform-Specific Configurations:** Review library installation instructions carefully for both iOS (Podfile) and Android (build.gradle) to ensure native platform integration is correctly set up.
4. **Linking (If Required):** Some libraries need manual linking. Follow the library's specific instructions for linking properly.
5. **Proper Import and Usage:** Double-check that you are importing and using the library's components and functions correctly according to the documentation.
6. **Clean and Rebuild:** Perform a thorough clean and rebuild of your project after any changes in package.json or configurations. 
7. **Debugging Tools:**  Use the React Native debugger and logging tools to help identify the exact location and cause of the error. 

Example of resolved import and use:

```javascript
// ThirdPartyBugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import SpecificComponent from 'react-native-third-party-library'; // Correct import

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <SpecificComponent someProp="value" />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
